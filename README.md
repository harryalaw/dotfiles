Place to store various dotfiles for easier sharing

## .zshrc
Currently playing with the following things that need installing: 
- [starship](https://starship.rs) as the prompt 
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) as an `ls` replacement
- bat as a `cat` replacement
- fzf
- tmux
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) as an `cd` alternative with better caching
- Also using [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) and [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
